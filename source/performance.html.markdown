I play piano, organ, violin, viola, flute, and recorder. Most of my work is in classical or Anglo-American folk music.

On the classical side of things, I have been working with [Opera Brittenica][opera brittenica] as musical director and/or accompanist for each of their innovative productions of Benjamin Britten operas. From 2001 until about 2010, I was the primary rehearsal pianist for the [Ridgewood Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Company][ridgewood]; I also played in their orchestra, generally as concertmaster or principal violist. Until 2007, when I left the New York City area for the wilds of Albany, I was a choral accompanist at [Blind Brook][blind brook] Middle and High School, and I played piano for ballet classes at [Sarah Lawrence College][slc]. Here in Boston, I play for ballet classes at [Boston Conservatory][boston conservatory], [Harvard University][harvard], and [Jos√© Mateo Ballet Theatre][jose mateo]. I've got lots of room in my schedule for more ballet work, so please get in touch if you need that!

My folk-music activities are largely centered around the various dance bands that I'm a member of. At the moment, this list includes [The Flying Romanos](romanos/), which plays mostly English country dance music, as well as several contra dance bands including Contrazz, Contramantra, and Squeezology. I'm also a musician for the Handsfor Dance Project, which seeks to combine hip-hop and contra dance. If you want to see what I'm currently up to, check out [my listing][dancedb listing] on Ted Crane's [DanceDB][dancedb].

I also do a fair amount of musical theater, and I have played Javanese gamelan music with [Gamelan Son of Lion][son of lion] and [Gamelan Kusuma Laras][kusuma laras] and Balinese gamelan music with [Gamelan Galak Tika][galak tika]. Also, from 2002 to 2003 I performed with the Renaissance-rock band [Blackmore's Night][blackmore's night] in the U.S. and 17 European countries under the name Lord Marnen of Wolfhurst; I appear on their recordings <cite>[Ghost of a Rose][amazon ghost of a rose]<img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=marnenlaibowkose&l=as2&o=1&a=B00009NJ93" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></cite> and <cite>[Live: Past Times With Good Company][amazon past times]<img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=marnenlaibowkose&l=as2&o=1&a=B00006LJ9Y" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></cite>.
