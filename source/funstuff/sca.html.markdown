title: SCA Humor
---

This section contains humor relating to the [Society for Creative Anachronism](http://www.sca.org), and historical reenactment in general. Non-SCAdians will likely be completely mystified (you have been warned!). Non-humorous SCA links are [over here](../links.html#sca).

* [Complete Information on Raising and Caring for your Peer][peer_manual]. The essential manual for squires and other owners of these necessary but troublesome creatures.
* [The Dictionary of SCA Slang][sca_slang], by Ioseph of Locksley. All right, maybe this isn't precisely humor, but it's still pretty damn funny.
* [The Knightly Knotebook][knightly], by [Viscount Galen of Bristol][galen]. Complete advice on how to be knightly.
* [Re-Enactors' 12-Step Program][twelve_step], by Magnus Maxwell. I guess you can have too much of *any* good thing...
* [SCA Garb Violation Notice!][garb_violation] There are some things that just aren't pre-1600, thank God.
* [Screwtape's SCA Letters][screwtape_sca], by [Viscount Galen of Bristol][galen]. C.S. Lewis meets the SCA. Absolutely hilarious, and dead on target. (The server is a little screwy, so it's a bit hard to connect sometimes, but keep trying--it's worth it!) Oh, and if this page puzzles you, it's probably because you haven't read C.S. Lewis's original [<cite>Screwtape Letters</cite>][screwtape_book] (also available in a [cheaper edition][screwtape_cheap], and on [audiocassette][screwtape_audio], read by John Cleese).
* [Top Ten and a Half Fun Things to Do at Pennsic War][top_ten]. 'Nuff said.
* [You Know You're in the SCA When...][you_know] To my knowledge, the most comprehensive list of its kind.
