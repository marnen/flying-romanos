title: E-mailed Funnies

Like most Netizens, I've received a fair amount of forwarded funny stuff by e-mail. This is an attempt at a central repository for such things. Since these pieces tend to be anonymously written, I have indicated the person from whom I received each item, in a vain attempt to figure out where these came from. If you have any information about when or where these originated, [get in touch](../../contact.html)--I'd love to hear from you! (**Note**: To the best of my knowledge, everything I have posted here is freely distributable. If I have inadvertently put something here that is not freely distributable, please [contact me](../../contact.html) so I can remove it. Thanks!)</p>
