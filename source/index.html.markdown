This is the site of [Marnen Laibow-Koser](about.html). I'm a composer and performing musician living in Medford, Massachusetts. (I'm also a programmer; more on that [here](web_development.html).)

I've been studying and playing music since the tender age of three, and composing for nearly as long. In December 2014, I completed my Master of Music degree in [Contemporary Improvisation][ci] at [New England Conservatory][nec] (formerly the Third Stream program), and I hope to begin doctoral study in 2017.

My [compositions](composition.html) are generally in an accessible modern classical style, although I sometimes write in other genres. As a multi-instrumentalist [performer](performance.html), I work mostly in classical and Anglo-American folk music, and can be found playing for numerous contra and English country dances in the Northeastern U.S. I am also an experienced [music copyist and engraver](music_copying.html).
