title: Composition
---

I've been composing as long as I've been playing music; I received First Prize in the Aaron Copland Competition for Young Composers in 1988. I particularly enjoy writing songs and chamber music. My compositions tend to be rather eclectic, often combining classical forms with popular-influenced materials; many of my more recent works reflect my interest in early music.

Some of my compositions are available for download as PDF files (I will add more as time permits):

<cite>Fantasia on Greensleeves</cite> for flute, violin, and viola
: This is a short work that I wrote as a surprise for two friends of mine. It was written to be easy enough for them to sight-read, but it's not as simple as that fact might suggest. The piece uses two versions of <cite>Greensleeves</cite>: the familiar modern version (in the outer sections) and a 17th-century version (in the middle section).

<cite>Isabella Regina, upon her Accession</cite> for SATB quartet or chorus
: This is an anthem in the Anglo-Italian Renaissance madrigal tradition, written for Queen Isabella of the [East Kingdom] of the [SCA][sca]. The text is a sonnet by Ana Areces (known in the SCA as Ana Ravaya de Guzm√°n) which was read at Queen Isabella's coronation. This piece tied for first place in the musical composition category in the Northern Lights A&S Pentathlon in 2004.
