title: Web Development
---

I've been developing Web applications since 1999, using a variety of technologies. Currently, I'm a senior-level [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com) developer, and I'm also experienced with client-side JavaScript and [CoffeeScript](http://www.coffeescript.org). I do a lot of open-source development (see my [GitHub profile](http://www.github.com/marnen) for more information); in particular, I've created the [Quorum](http://www.github.com/marnen/quorum2) calendar system.

Other programming interests of mine include algorithmic music research, as well as [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org).

# Freelance work

I'm an experienced freelancer and contractor (check out my [résumé](resume.pdf)), and I love developing software that lets people be more productive than they ever thought possible. I take a user-centered approach to information architecture and UI design, and under the hood I rigorously test and refactor *everything*. So if you hire me, you know that you'll get software that is *easy* for you to use, *reliable* to run, and *simple* for me or anyone else to maintain and extend.

I love working with non-technical and technical clients alike; I believe in making quality Web applications accessible to any business or individual with a good idea. So if you'd like to hire me, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](contact.html)!
