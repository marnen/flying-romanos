title: Engraving and Copying
---

I have many years of experience as a music engraver and copyist, and I will happily take on just about any conceivable engraving assignment. All the PDF files of [my own compositions](composition.html) are my own engraving work; you might also want to look at my [transcriptions][caroso] of Italian Renaissance lute tablature (there are some files on that page from another transcriber too, but everything is clearly credited). If you'd like to have me engrave your manuscript, or if you'd like to see more samples of my work, please [contact me](contact.html)!
