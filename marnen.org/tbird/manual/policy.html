		<h1><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" color="#000099">Terms, Conditions and Acceptable Use Policy</font></h1>
		<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2">Thunderbird Productions (&quot;Thunderbird&quot;) provides web page hosting, marketing, and development. Thunderbird Productions has certain legal and ethical responsibilities consisting with the use of its server and equipment involved in these services.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2">Thunderbird's general policy is to act as a provider of internet presence. Thunderbird Productions has specific ethical concerns regarding the use of its computers detailed below. Thunderbird reserves the right to suspend or cancel a customer's access to any or all services provided or resold by Thunderbird when we decide that the account has been inappropriately used.</font></p>
		<h2><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" color="#000080">Specific Acceptable Use Policies</font></h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" color="#000080" size="2"><b>Server abuse</b></font><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2"><b><br>
			</b></font><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2">Any attempt to undermine or cause harm to a server, or customer, of Thunderbird Productions is strictly prohibited.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" color="#000080" size="2"><b>Unauthorized use of other people's accounts or computers<br>
			</b></font><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2">Thunderbird Productions will strongly react to any use or attempted use of an Internet account or computer without the owner's authorization. Such attempts include &quot;internet scamming&quot; (tricking other people into releasing their passwords), password robbery, security hole scanning etc.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2">Any unauthorized use of accounts or computers by a Thunderbird customer, whether or not the attacked account or computer belongs to Thunderbird Productions, will result in action against the attacker. Possible actions include warnings, account suspension or cancellation, and civil or criminal legal action, depending on the seriousness of the attack.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" color="#000080" size="2"><b>Abuse of Unlimited Traffic<br>
			</b></font><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2">Thunderbird customers are privileged to be offered unlimited traffic. Unlimited traffic applies to all standard web documents (JPEG, GIF and HTML). All other types of files (such as ZIP, MP3, etc.) are subject to 3 gigabytes (GB) of transfer a month. Sites containing paid advertisements, such as banner ads, are allowed 6 GB of transfer per month. Any customer who exceeds this limit will be notified by Thunderbird to resolve the situation.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2">To maintain the integrity of our service the following limitations apply:</font></p>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2">Thunderbird Productions will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes a violation of this provision</font></p>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" color="#000080" size="2"><b>Commercial advertisements with e-mail<br>
			</b></font><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2">Unsolicited commercial advertisements are not allowed in e-mail, and will likely result in account suspension or cancellation.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2">Commercial advertisements are unwelcome in most Usenet discussion groups and on most e-mail mailing lists. Inappropriate posting may result in account suspension or cancellation. See the newsgroup or mailing list's charter for whether advertising is allowed or not. &quot;Spamming,&quot; or sending a message to many different off-topic newsgroups, is particularly unethical and will be treated as such.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2">Sending a message, especially an advertisement, to more than five or six recipients, is by itself spamming unless the individuals have specifically requested to be added to a mailing list on that topic. E-mail is a person-to-person medium, not a broadcast medium.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" color="#000080" size="2"><b>Chat Rooms</b></font><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2"><b><br>

			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" color="#000080" size="2"><b>Background Running Programs</b></font><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2"><b><br>
			</b></font><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2">We may allow programs to run continually in the background. These are considered on a one-to-one basis and an extra charge will be incurred based on system resources used and operational maintenance needed.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" color="#000080" size="2"><b>IRC</b></font><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2"><b><br>
			</b></font><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" size="2">We do not allow IRC or IRC bots to be operated on our servers.</font></p>
