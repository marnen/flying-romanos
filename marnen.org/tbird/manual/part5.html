		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">The sophisticated mailing system called PlusMail(tm) is included as part of your service. In addition to being able to have nearly unlimited infobots by simply adding text files to a directory, you can also redirect mail for everyone in your domain by simply modifying a text file.</font></p>

		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">There is a file in your home (root) directory called .redirect. This file can be edited and reuploaded. Just make sure that each of your redirects is on its own line, with a space between the name and where you want it directed to. Don't add empty lines between entries, and make sure the file is saved in text (ASCII) format, and uploaded in text (not binary) format. When you download it to your hard drive, you will see that it already has a one-line entry that looks like this:</font></p>
		<p><code>default yourdomain@yourdomain.com </code></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">This line must be left as is, otherwise your POP e-mail accounts could get messed up. But suppose you want all e-mail for your domain to go to your already existing POP account somewhere else. You would then change your .redirect file to look like this:</font></p>
		<p><code>default yourdomain@yourdomain.com<br>
		yourdomain existingaddress@somewhereelse.com</code></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">If you want to redirect other names in your domain to other people, you could make the file look like this, as an example:</font></p>
		<p><code>default yourdomain@yourdomain.com<br>
		fred 73452.452@compuserve.com<br>
		info goddess@afterlife.com</code></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">This would redirect mail for fred@yourdomain.com to 73452.452@compuserve.com, info@yourdomain.com to goddess@afterlife.com, and all other e-mail in your domain would go to yourdomain@yourdomain.com. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">The benefit of PlusMail redirects is that you don't need a separate POP account for each e-mail address you want to use in your domain. You can put in your webpages, &quot;Send e-mail to help@yourdomain.com&quot; without the need to create a separate entry in the .redirect file because ALL e-mail goes by default to yourdomain@yourdomain.com, unless &quot;help&quot; is specified to go somewhere else! </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">Multiple redirection is possible. For instance if you want e-mail to go to two addresses at the same time, enter the different e-mails with a comma to separate them, no spaces. For example:</font></p>
		<p><code>help JohnSmith@aol.com,HenryAdams@prodigy.net</code></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif"><b>Important Note:</b> after you make changes to the .redirect file it can take up to 15 minutes for those changes to take effect.</font></p>

		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">An autoresponder is a simple way of setting up an e-mail address which will return a message automatically when someone sends e-mail to it. Here are the instructions for setting this up.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">In your root (home) directory, there is a directory called infobots. Set up a welcome message in this directory -- you can name it anything you like, but for our example we'll call it info. Don't call it info.txt -- just name it plain info with no file extension. The text for the welcome message could say:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">&quot;Thank you for requesting more information about our webpage design package. We have several design packages to choose from. Here are our prices...&quot;</font></blockquote>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">Now, whenever someone sends e-mail to info@yourdomain.com they will automatically receive that text e-mail message to whatever e-mail address they specified as their return-to address. It's as simple as that. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">How do I see who is using my infobots?</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">Assume your infobot address is info@example.com.<br>
		Just put the following line in your .redirect file.</font></p>
		<pre>





<font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">info example@example.com<br>




</font>

</pre>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">The original e-mail message will be sent to example@example.com, and theoriginal sender will get the infobot text.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif"><i><b>Important Note:</b></i><b> Please be sure to put the text file in the infobot directory before putting it in your .redirect or the infobot will not work.</b> </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">You can have as many autoresponders as you want. Just save them all in the infobots directory and give them each a unique name between 3 and16 characters long.</font></p>

		</font></p>

		<pre>





<font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">add1@email1.com</font>
<font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">add2@email2.com</font>
<font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">add3@email3.com</font></pre>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">You can put upto 1000 names in the list. Once you are done creating the list you goto your home directory and put the list in the subdirectory maillists. The list may be named anything you like; it's important that there be no extension on the end.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">Example:<br>
		clients (good name); clients.txt (no good)</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">To use the list you just need to mail to the name of the list. Using the above example with a domain name of fred.com, to e-mail the list you would send to clients@fred.com. It's that simple! Note that if your maillist is named clients it cannot be used in the infobots directory or the .redirect file.</font></p>

		<h2><font size="4" color="#000099" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif"><a name="listservers"></a></font><font color="#000099" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">Listservers</font></h2>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">PlusMail can also be used to create simple listservers. There is a limit of 1,000 subscribers per listserver and you cannot send e-mail to the list larger than 75k. Here are the instructions for setting up a listserver: </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">1) Set up a welcome message in the infobot directory -- you can name it anything you like, but for our example we'll call it welcome.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">The text file could say:</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">&quot;Welcome to our listserver. You are now subscribed and any e-mail you wish to publish for all other subscribers to see can be sent to listserver@yourdomain.com.&quot; </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">This message will be automatically returned to the sender each time someone subscribes.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">2) Now you need to set up a configuration file to tell the mail system to build a mailing list. In your infobot directory create a file called infolist. This is used to tell the system what to do with addresses received from each infobot response. You can have as many lists as you want. But in keeping with the listserver example above, we will call it listserver.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">Here's what the file should look like: </font></p>
		<p><code>welcome listserver</code></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">The first line should have a space between the two names and be uploaded in text format, not binary. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">You can have multiple listservers, such as listserver1, listserver2, etc., but you should only have one configuration file. It must be called infolist. To handle all three examples, you'd make the infolist file look like this, with each listserver on its own line, with no blank lines in-between: </font></p>
		<p><code>welcome listserver<br>
		welcome2 listserver2<br>
		welcome3 listserver3</code></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">2A) Now when someone wants to subscribe to your list in the above example, they would e-mail welcome@yourdomain.com. This would return the infobot created called &quot;welcome&quot; and put their e-mail address into the mailing list file in the maillists directory on your server. You can go in and download the maillist file after it has been created and people have subscribed. The mailing list file will be created AFTER the first person subscribes, or if you yourself send e-mail to &quot;welcome@yourdomain.com&quot; to test it. Put yourself on the mailing list to try this. People don't need to subscribe themselves -- you can add their names for them, or remove them at any time by modifying and uploading the file in the &quot;maillists&quot; directory. People cannot automatically unsubscribe themselves. You must go in and manually remove their e-mail address from the list.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">3) Now when you or anyone who has subscribed to the list wants to send mail to all subscribers, you or they can send e-mail to listserver@yourdomain.com and the PlusMail system will send it to the entire list.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">4) To password-protect the file, add a password to the first line of your maillists file. In order to mail to the list, this password must be in the first line in the body of the message. Anybody that sends to the list without the password will have their message sent to the default address in the .redirect file. You can then decide if you want them to mail to the list and give them the password if you desire.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">5) If you want to see who is subscribing to your listserver without having to go and check the maillists file periodically by FTP, you can put a line in your .redirect file. NOTE: it is important that you have the infobot installed before entering the address line in the .redirect. For the listserver example we used above, the line you would add would look like this:</font></p>
		<p><code>welcome yourdomain@yourdomain.com</code></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">The welcome document you created will be sent to the subscriber, AND you will receive their e-mail message. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">Note: When sending e-mail to your listserver for the first time, you will get the autoresponder e-mail back right away, but you may not see the corresponding maillist file right away, as our system takes time to build it. Wait 15 or 30 minutes or so and it will show up. (Depending on the time of day and current traffic conditions, our servers may be allocating it to a lower priority.) <csobj w="580" h="38" t="Component" csref="../../../marnen.org.data/Components/manfooter.html" occur="0"><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif">
